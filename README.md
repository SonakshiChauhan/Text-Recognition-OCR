•	OCR stands for optical character recognition.
•	Recognizing hand-written and printed characters that can be recognized and converted into machine readable text

Different Techniques used in OCR
•	Pre-Processing:
  o	Improvement of image data
  o	Supression of unwanted distortions and removal of noise
•	Character Recognition:
  o	Feature extraction is extracting out reduced set of features
  o	Those features extracted are important ones and redundant ones are knocked out
•	Post-Processing
  o	Error Correction and Accuracy improving technique
  o	Accuracy can be further improved by using lexicon, which implied algo has list of words to refer to as allowed words
  o	OCR systems are accompanied by image scanning and optimization techniques
